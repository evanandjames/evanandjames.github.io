      <div class="song-story">
        <p>
        Nights Like These was written primarily by Andrew James. The song is inspired by
        “Brown Eyed Girl” by Van Morrison, which is known for its upbeat vibe and
        catchy style. It also features a key change similar to that found in the
        song “My Girl” by the Temptations, lifting up a whole step from the key of
        C to the key of D. The music came first, with its bright, upbeat vibe, and
        the lyrics followed soon after, reflecting the excitement and fleeting magic
        of special nights spent with someone memorable. The song was finished in
        just a few hours, capturing that spontaneous, joyful energy.</p>
        <p>
        Lyrically, the song explores moments of connection and fun — the kind of
        night that feels alive and unforgettable. Lines like “When the night has
        come to an end / I lie in bed and think to myself” capture the reflective
        side, while the chorus, “Nights like these they come once / In a blue moon,”
        emphasizes the rarity and excitement of these experiences. Overall, the
        track is meant to lift spirits and boost moods, celebrating the small but
        powerful moments that bring joy.</p>
        <p>
        A few months later, Andrew teamed up with his bandmate, Christopher Evan,
        to refine and record the track together. With both of their contributions,
        the song came fully to life and became the title song of the duo’s first
        album.</p>

      <div class="song-story">
    <p>
      A Place For You was written primarily by Andrew James while on a religious trip 
      to Bosnia in August 2022. Although surrounded by friends who cared for him, 
      Andrew found himself frustrated by the constant social energy. He craved 
      solitude and space to be creative, and during one quiet moment alone in his 
      hotel room, the song began to take shape. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Lyrically, the song explores the tension between belonging and individuality. 
      The verses highlight how people often have expectations or advice, while the 
      choruses reassure that it’s okay to be different, and that there is still a 
      place where you belong. The bridge underscores the importance of solitude, 
      suggesting that when you’re alone, your true calling becomes clearer. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Later, Andrew teamed up with his bandmate, Christopher Evan, who added subtle 
      but meaningful contributions that helped polish and complete the track. With 
      its reflective lyrics and uplifting message, A Place For You became a heartfelt 
      addition to the duo’s debut album.

      <div class="song-story">
    <p>My New Home was written primarily by Andrew James in his car during the late
        hours of the night. The song captures the feeling of discovering a place where
        you truly belong. Musically, it blends bright, inviting melodies with gentle
        rhythmic elements that give it an uplifting, welcoming vibe. The verses focus
        on observing the people and the energy around the narrator, while the repeated
        line “I feel like it’s my new home” emphasizes the sense of comfort and acceptance.</p>

    <p>Lyrically, the song explores the emotional journey of adjusting to a new
        environment — from initial uncertainty to eventual belonging. The bridge
        highlights that transformation, acknowledging initial hesitation before
        celebrating the joy of finding a place where you fit in. The guitar solo
        and repeated bridge sections add emotional depth, reinforcing the song’s
        theme of homecoming and connection. Overall, the track conveys warmth and
        optimism, inviting listeners to feel the same sense of home and peace.</p>

    <p>When working on the album, Andrew teamed up with his bandmate, Christopher
        Evan, to refine and record the track together. Christopher added elements

    </div>

  <div class="song-story">
    <p>
      Make You Feel Loved was written by Andrew James as a deeply personal reflection 
      on his relationship with his second girlfriend. When they first met, she shared 
      her story of struggles and pain, and Andrew was struck by her strength and 
      endurance. From that place of empathy, he felt a natural desire to comfort her 
      and to create a song dedicated to making her feel cared for. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Lyrically, the song blends intimacy with hope. The verses express tenderness 
      and compassion, while the bridge emphasizes the universal longing for support 
      and protection. The repeated promise to “make you feel loved” anchors the 
      track in warmth, reminding listeners of the healing power of love and 
      connection. The guitar solo and extended ending add emotional weight, carrying 
      the song to a heartfelt conclusion. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Later, Andrew collaborated with his bandmate, Christopher Evan, who contributed

        </iframe>
    </div>

  <div class="song-story">
     <p>
      Man on the Moon was inspired by some of Paul McCartney’s unreleased work from 
      the 1970s, particularly the track “All of You” from the <i>One Hand Clapping</i> 
      sessions. The music was created first by Andrew James, who wanted to capture 
      that playful, whimsical energy. Later, bandmate Christopher Evan joined 
      in to help craft the lyrics.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lyrics tell the story of a carefree figure, the “man on the moon”, who 
      is always smiling, full of joy, and seemingly untouched by life’s troubles. 
      While others may overlook him, the narrator notices his wisdom and light. 
      Through verses and pre-choruses that invite listeners to “take a look” and 
      see more deeply, the track builds toward a chorus that links this figure to 
      the narrator’s own sense of belonging and connection: “You and I were meant 
      to be / Just like the man on the moon.” 
    </p>

    <p>
      Musically, the song flows with whimsical melodies, a gentle piano interlude, and 
      a dramatic ending that ties everything together. With Andrew’s musical 
      foundation and Christopher’s lyrical contributions, Man on the Moon became a 
      unique standout on the album.

  <div class="song-story">
     <p>
      Lost in Love was written primarily by Christopher Evan, and it tells the story of 
      his first experience with love. The song captures the thrilling rush of a new 
      relationship, how it can be both exhilarating and disorienting, like getting swept 
      away in a dream. Although the relationship ended years before the song was written, 
      Christopher used this piece as a way to reflect and find the closure he never had 
      at the time. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Lyrically, the verses paint vivid snapshots of young romance: late-night drives, 
      kisses in the dark, and carefree adventures that feel like scenes from a movie. 
      The recurring pre-chorus lines, “No destination, no limitation, just you and I”, 
      emphasize the freedom and intensity of living in the moment, while the chorus 
      simply and powerfully sums it up: “’Cause we’re lost in love.” The repetition 
      mirrors the overwhelming, consuming feeling of love in its purest form. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Musically, the song blends simple melodies with a dynamic build, from tender 
      verses to passionate pre-choruses and a chorus that lingers long after it’s sung. 
      A synthesizer solo and extended final chorus amplify the emotional impact, giving the 
      track both intimacy and grandeur. With Christopher’s heartfelt writing and 
      performance, Lost in Love became one of the most personal and reflective songs 
      on the album.

    </div>

  <div class="song-story">
    <p>
      Little Dream was written primarily by Andrew James, and the melody first came 
      to him while he was driving to Christopher’s house for a rehearsal. He had been 
      listening to the Beatles’ rendition of the “Honeymoon Song” from their 
      <i>Live at the BBC</i> album, and its lively shuffle rhythm immediately captured 
      his imagination. Inspired by that energy, Andrew began shaping the foundation 
      of what would become Little Dream during the drive. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Once he arrived at Christopher’s, he shared the melodic idea, and together the 
      duo completed the song on the spot. Lyrically, the track personifies a dream 
      as a guiding force, something that believes in the narrator and offers both 
      purpose and direction. Lines like “Little dream, make me feel like I’m alive 
      again” and “Why is it you chose me?” highlight both wonder and gratitude, 
      giving the song a heartfelt and uplifting tone. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Musically, Little Dream blends the shuffle-inspired rhythm with warm melodies 
      and harmonies, creating a playful yet sincere sound. The chorus “I will trust 
      in you, and I will see it through” reinforces the theme of faith and 
      perseverance. A soaring solo and instrumental outro round out the track, 
      leaving listeners with a sense of hope and forward motion. The spontaneity of 
      its creation shines through, making it one of the album’s most organic and 
      spirited songs.

  <div class="song-story">
     <p>
      The Way to Carry On is one of the rare songs that Andrew James and Christopher Evan 
      wrote together from the start. The initial musical idea came from Andrew, who drew 
      inspiration from the Beatles’ cover of “Don’t Ever Change”. With both of their creative voices involved, 
      the song quickly developed into a balanced blend of melody, message, and wit. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Lyrically, the song pokes fun at the monotony of everyday routines — especially the 
      draining cycle of 9-to-5 jobs and the soullessness that often comes with them. Lines 
      like “Everybody’s wearing a frown” and “Everybody’s self-esteem is breaking at the 
      seams” capture the frustration of modern working life, while the chorus-like bridge 
      offers encouragement: “Pain is all around and though you may feel down, now you 
      know the way to carry on.” The result is both a critique of dull repetition and a 
      reminder of resilience. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Musically, the track carries a playful, Beatles-inspired charm with bright melodies, 
      a lively guitar solo, and a catchy rhythm that keeps the listener moving forward. 
      Together, Andrew and Christopher infused humor, honesty, and hope into the song, 
      turning a commentary on the burdens of daily life into an anthem about finding 
      strength and perseverance.

  <div class="song-story">
    <p>
      Love Sweet Love was written by Andrew James as a bright, uplifting one-off track. 
      The direct inspiration came from the medley at the end of Paul McCartney’s 
      <em>Red Rose Speedway</em> album, whose joyous and melodic vibe sparked the creation 
      of this song. Andrew sought to capture that same sense of warmth and positivity, 
      creating a piece that feels timelessly cheerful and universally relatable. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The lyrics are intentionally simple and straightforward, revolving around the 
      undeniable feeling of being in love. Refrains like “I can’t deny that I’m in love, 
      sweet love” embrace the joy of connection without complication, while the bridge 
      reflects on the first spark of attraction and the happiness it brings. The message 
      is clear: love is something to celebrate openly and honestly. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Musically, the song blends playful verses with supporting harmonies and a lively guitar
      solo that ties everything together. Its optimistic spirit make it a track that radiates
      positivity. The result is a simple yet powerful ode to love itself: bright, melodic, and full of life.

  <div class="song-story">
    <p>
      Can’t You See is one of Andrew James’s earliest works, written during his time at 
      Cornell University. Composed in the privacy of his single dorm room bed, the song 
      reflects the raw emotion and longing of a young songwriter navigating love and 
      vulnerability. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Musically, it draws inspiration from 1950s ballads — timeless, tender songs built on 
      simple melodies and heartfelt lyrics. The verses plead for love and memory to endure, 
      while the bridge opens up into an emotional declaration that “love is kind,” capturing 
      the sincerity at the heart of the track. 
    </p>

    <p>
      What makes the song resonate is its simplicity. With no frills or overproduction, 
      Can’t You See lets the lyrics and melody shine, creating an atmosphere that feels both 
      nostalgic and deeply personal. It stands as a beautiful early glimpse into Andrew’s 
      songwriting voice and his ability to connect universal themes of love.

  <div class="song-story">
    <p>
      Bye Bye Lai was written by Andrew James on a plane from New York to Bosnia in August 2022.
      The song captures the raw emotions of heartbreak and betrayal, reflecting the moment of
      clarity when love has ended and self-reliance takes over. Musically, it draws inspiration
      from the upbeat energy of the Beach Boys, particularly “Help Me Rhonda,” blending an upbeat,
      melodic style with the weight of the lyrics. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Lyrically, the song traces the journey from initial hurt and disbelief to decisive 
      independence. The verses detail personal experiences of unfaithfulness, while the 
      choruses, repeating “Bye Bye Lai, I'm going home,” emphasize the finality and resolve 
      of leaving a toxic relationship. Bass, guitar solos, and harmonies enrich the track, 
      adding emotional depth and musical sophistication. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Collaboration with Christopher Evan enhanced the song’s instrumentation and vocal 
      harmonies, turning the initial plane-written idea into a fully realized track. 
      Overall, Bye Bye Lai combines storytelling, musical craftsmanship, and emotional 
      honesty, making it a standout reflection on betrayal, love lost, and personal strength.
